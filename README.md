# Key remap for Dell Latitude 7410 Chromebook for Linux Fedora 42
This particular laptop model has a keyboard with a different layout than normal keyboards.
The "Caps Lock" button is the Super key(Windows key) and the Planet key(where the windows button is located)
is for changing the language. \
This script provides a clean solution to the problem. You need to run the script only once and eveything is done.

# !DISCLAIMER!
This is only tested on the model above on the Fedora 42. 

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the shell script

```
git clone https://github.com/vichmi/chromebook-keyboard-fix.git

Reboot.
